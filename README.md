Overview of the Project

Project Title: Speech Recognition System for Command-Based Control of Devices

Objective: Design and develop a speech recognition system that can interpret voice commands and control devices accordingly.

System Description: The system uses a speech recognition library to convert spoken words into text, which is then interpreted as a command to control a device. The system can be integrated with various devices, such as LEDs, relays, and other IoT devices.

Key Features:
1. Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text using a speech recognition library.
2. Command Interpretation: Interprets text output as a command to control a device.
3. Device Control: Controls devices based on interpreted commands.
4. Voice Command: Allows users to control devices using voice commands.

Hardware Components:
1. Embedded Board: Raspberry Pi or Arduino Due
2. Microphone: USB microphone or analog microphone with amplifier
3. Speaker: Optional, for audio feedback
4. Device to Control: LED, relay, or other device to control

Software Components:
1. Speech Recognition Library: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Services, or Mozilla DeepSpeech
2. Programming Language: Python, C++, or Java
3. Device Control Library: Library for controlling the device, such as RPi.GPIO for Raspberry Pi

Applications:
1. Home Automation: Control home appliances using voice commands.
2. IoT Applications: Control IoT devices using voice commands.
3. Assistive Technology: Assist people with disabilities using voice-controlled devices.
